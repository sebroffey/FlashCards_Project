# FlashCards_Project

The purpose of this small project is to showcase my current understanding of Flask, Databases and Python. This is my first ever project using flask so there are probably areas which I made very long winded for the sake of practice. I have included a virutual enviroment of which you can interprete the program from with all the needed libraries. Please refer to requirements.txt if you want to know the technologies involved.

# Function
The project is a simple flash cards website inspired by a course on pluralsight, but done in a different way, including a database to store user information and card information. Users can log in securely, and then can view their cards, use a practice page to cycle through their flashcards, and then finally test themselves on each card and be scored. Users are automatically assigned a username upon registration, but all of the users details can be changed once logged into their account via "view details". Any passwords used are hashed and stored securely.

The project is now fully functional and can be run with the included virtual enviroment attached in the folder venv. I have used javascript for some of the testing functions which in the future I would like to emplement this server side for security reasons, but for now I wanted to also use javascript for the first time and to use it along side jinja. The project can also use some further optimisation.
