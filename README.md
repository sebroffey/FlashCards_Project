# FlashCards_Project

The purpose of this small project is to showcase my current understanding of Flask, Databases and Python. This is my first ever project using flask so there are probably areas which I made very long winded for the sake of practice. I have included a virutual enviroment of which you can interprete the program from with all the needed libraries. Please refer to requirements.txt if you want to know the technologies involved.

# Function
The project is a simple flash cards website inspired by a course on pluralsight, but done in a different way, including a database to store user information and card information. Users can log in securely, and then can view their cards, use a practice page to cycle through their flashcards, and then finally test themselves on each card and be scored. Users are automatically assigned a username upon registration, but all of the users details can be changed once logged into their account via "view details". Any passwords used are hashed and stored securely.

Please look at the current attached commit message to see the current progress of the project.
